# 8-Week Python Machine Learning Journey 🚀
Welcome to the 8-Week Python Machine Learning Journey! This roadmap is meticulously designed to guide you through mastering Python scripting, data mining, data cleaning, model training, and supervised machine learning. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to consolidate their knowledge, this journey is structured to provide incremental, hands-on learning, day by day.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized into weekly folders. Each week focuses on a specific milestone, and inside each week's folder, you'll find daily folders packed with scripts, exercises, and Jupyter notebooks tailored for that day's learning objectives.
